# Cover stories

[Here all the probabilties are shown from pgroup3: A=.1,Au=.7,B=.8,Bu=.5]

There are three cover stories. In slightly condensed form, they are:

> The situation is ... a person walking down a street full of cafes, looking for a place to eat. They have already decided what they want to eat: a main dish, a dessert, or both. They read the menus, and decide whether to enter and eat something. If the food is on the menu and they want to eat it, they will enter the cafe. [10%] of the cafes have main dishes and [80%] have desserts. The person wants to eat a main dish [70%] of the time and wants to eat a dessert [50%] of the time. The person enters the cafe to order if [either one / both ] of the main dish or dessert is on the menu and the person wants to eat what is on the menu.

> The situation is ... an afternoon university seminar class. The class is compulsory, but two particular students only sometimes attend. These two students are intelligent, passionate, articulate and well-read. However, even when they attend, they are only in the mood to talk if they have had a good morning! (Their morning and hence their mood does not affect how likely they are to turn up; a bad morning just makes them quiet.) But if they attend and had a good morning, there will always be a good discussion. The first student attends [10%] of the time and the second student attends [80%] of the time. The first student has a good morning [70%] of the time, and the second student has a good morning [50%] of the time. A good discussion always happens when [either/both] student attends and had a good morning.

> The situation is a work meeting, where a company is trying to sell a product to a client. The presenter introduces some features in a talk, and then opens files to demonstrate. However, the laptop files are sometimes randomly corrupted and fail to open! The presenter does not know in advance which files are corrupted. The product has Feature A and Feature B, and the client will always
accept the product if they see a working demonstration of [either/both] feature[/s]. The company presents Feature A [10%] of the time and Feature B [80%] of the time. The underlying laptop files for Feature A are sometimes corrupted: they only work [70%] of the time, whether the feature is presented or not.
The underlying laptop files for Feature B are sometimes corrupted: they only work [50%] of the time, whether the feature is presented or not.
