  keywords = {Actual causation, Bayes nets, Causal reasoning, Counterfactuals, Normality, Sampling},
  abstract = {People's judgments of actual causation can be influenced by the degree to which they regard certain events as normal. This paper develops an explanation using graphical causal models and probabilistic sampling, proposing a new measure of actual causal strength that captures normality effects including abnormal inflation, supersession, and predicts a new effect called abnormal deflation.},
